    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you’ve ever had rice pudding, then you’ll know that rice can definitely be a dessert ingredient. However, Thai sticky rice takes dessert to a whole new level. Combined with a sweet coconut milk sauce and fresh mango, this mango sticky rice recipe is moreish and will have you coming back for more.

        I have an admission to make- when I first started making this dish at home, I may or may not have boiled the rice, rather than steamed – gasp! I know, I know- that just isn’t right – which is why I now always steam the rice, and the results are incredible!</p>


        <p>The glutinous rice has a deliciously sticky, almost ‘sushi rice’ style texture, which soaks up the sweet coconut milk sauce to become deliciously gooey. Meanwhile, the fresh mango slices cut through the richness of the rice and coconut milk. Overall, this dessert appeals to those wanting something light AND decadent.</p>
